\subsection{Patterns Noticed Within My Own Discussion Posts and Responses}
  I regards to my discussion posts, I notice that I almost always tend to open
    each \textit{response} the same way --- with a phrase generally denoting
    ``good work'' and utilizing the name of the author of the original initial
    post \parencite{%
    hellwig_julayne_2020,hellwig_cherylee_2020,hellwig_kristyna_2020%
    }. I believe I could be using this as a crutch, as it is difficult for me
    to come up with an ``opening line'', so to speak, when it comes to
    responding to these discussion posts authored by my classmates.

  I have also noticed that I tend to simply ask the question ``why'' a lot.
    I find that it is the easiest way to (hopefully) continue a conversation.
    We can even see this in my recent discussion response post to Diata Hart
    in the final practice discussion of the course. In that response, perhaps
    my words could have been declared \textit{critical} of Diata's viewpoint
    when it comes to the development of interpersonal communication skills
    \parencite{hellwig_diata_2020}.
