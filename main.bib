	abstract = {The present study addressed empathy's role in conflict resolution within the context of adolescent same-sex friendship relations. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess dispositional affective empathy and conflict resolution styles (problem solving, conflict engagement, withdrawal and compliance). The data of 307 adolescents (149 boys, 158 girls) were included in a multigroup path analysis with sex as a moderator variable. In agreement with the hypothesis that higher levels of dispositional empathy are associated with more successful conflict management, dispositional affective empathy was found to be positively linked to problem solving and negatively linked to conflict engagement among adolescent boys and girls. Dispositional affective empathy was not related to the two more passive strategies (withdrawal and compliance). Sex differences were demonstrated in empathic tendencies, with girls being more empathic than boys. Sex differences were also established in conflict resolution strategies, with girls using problem solving, withdrawal and compliance more frequently than boys. Both sexes scored equally low on conflict engagement, however, and were found to prefer problem solving to all other conflict resolution strategies. Findings are discussed in terms of previous research on empathy and conflict resolution. Aggr. Behav. 33:48–55, 2007. © 2006 Wiley-Liss; Inc.},

	abstract = {The authors compared 2004-08 undergraduate and graduate students with one another, test norms, and pre-1987 or pre-1990 undergraduates on ascendancy/self-assuredness, impulse control, achievement assets, psychological health, and narcissism. The 2004-08 undergraduates scored substantially lower than pre-1987 undergraduates on psychological health, achievement assets, and impulse control, somewhat lower on ascendancy/self-assuredness, and higher than pre-1990 undergraduates on narcissism. The 2004-08 graduate students were more similar to pre-1987 and pre-1990 undergraduates than they were to 2004-08 undergraduates. Analysis of means for different personality types enabled more refined descriptions of the characteristics of 2004-08 university students. The authors argue that a decline in academic assets, increased externality and an over-emphasis on self-worth goals adversely affect current students' academic performance. They also suggest that the increased prevalence of externally oriented and low Fulfillment students exacerbates negative faculty perceptions of this college-attending generation.},
